# Intro to SQL & Databases

This project is a *thorough* introductory course
    in **[SQL <img height="12" style="display: inline-block" src="static/link/to_wiki.png">](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL)**
    and **[databases <img height="12" style="display: inline-block" src="static/link/to_wiki.png">](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database)**
    based on the free and open-source database **[PostgreSQL <img height="12" style="display: inline-block" src="static/link/to_postgres.png">](https://www.postgresql.org/)** (or "Postgres" for short).


## Installation

To follow this course, an installation of **PostgreSQL 13** or higher is expected.
If you know how to do this on your own machine,
    you may do so at your own discretion.
Yet, to ensure that
    each student has a development environment
    similar to the instructor's one,
    follow this *extensive* **[installation tutorial](INSTALL.md)**
    and set up a [virtual machine <img height="12" style="display: inline-block" src="static/link/to_wiki.png">](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine)
    with all the required software on it.
The estimated time for this should be around *one hour*.


## Contributing

Feedback **is highly encouraged** and will be incorporated.
Open an issue in the [issues tracker <img height="12" style="display: inline-block" src="static/link/to_gh.png">](https://github.com/webartifex/intro-to-sql/issues)
    or initiate a [pull request <img height="12" style="display: inline-block" src="static/link/to_gh.png">](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests)
    if you are familiar with the concept.
Simple issues that *anyone* can **help fix** are, for example,
    **spelling mistakes** or **broken links**.
If you feel that some topic is missing entirely, you may also mention that.
The materials here are considered a **permanent work-in-progress**.
